We need some refinement around setting the gitlab
endpoint in the config file setup script, as well as
the rabbitmq endpoint. If you make a mistake with
either, the application is broken and it's difficult to
track down. We should validate the entries, somehow.

There is also non-obvious errors. For example, if you
make the gitlab endpoint URL start with 'https://', it
will never work. Even if you are using TLS, you have to
make the endpoint string start with 'http://', which
doesn't make sense. For the rabbitmq endpoint, it
always ends with ':5671/%2f?auth_mechanism=external'
and for the gitlab endpoint, it's always '/apt/v4'
