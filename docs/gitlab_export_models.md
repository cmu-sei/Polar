# Gitlab API
Gitlab provides a RESTful API to users and developers to enable them to carry out certain operations through HTTP requests. Using this API, we can extract relevant information about aspects of a provided organization's development environemt, such as but not limited to
* Users and Groups
* Projects
* Runners
* Container Registries

Gitlab assigns each of these a unique id value that we can use to identify relationships between them and other resources in the environment. Some of which are actually already known to Gitlab, as requests can be made to retrieve, for example, projects and which groups have access to them

```
GET /projects/:id/groups

returns

[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Foobar Group",
    "avatar_url": "http://localhost:3000/uploads/group/avatar/1/foo.jpg",
    "web_url": "http://localhost:3000/groups/foo-bar",
    "full_name": "Foobar Group",
    "full_path": "foo-bar"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Shared Group",
    "avatar_url": "http://gitlab.example.com/uploads/group/avatar/1/bar.jpg",
    "web_url": "http://gitlab.example.com/groups/foo/bar",
    "full_name": "Shared Group",
    "full_path": "foo/shared"
  }
]
```
and vice versa

```
GET /groups/:id/projects
[
  {
    "id": 9,
    "description": "foo",
    "default_branch": "master",
    "tag_list": [], //deprecated, use `topics` instead

    "web_url": "http://gitlab.example.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate",
    "name": "Html5 Boilerplate",
    "name_with_namespace": "Experimental / Html5 Boilerplate",
    "path": "html5-boilerplate",
    "path_with_namespace": "h5bp/html5-boilerplate",
    "issues_enabled": true,

    "shared_runners_enabled": true,
    "creator_id": 1,
    "namespace": {
      "id": 5,
      "name": "Experimental",

      "kind": "group"
    },
    "avatar_url": null,
    "star_count": 1,
    "forks_count": 0,
    "open_issues_count": 3,
    "public_jobs": true,
    "shared_with_groups": [],
    "request_access_enabled": false
  }
]
```

It should be noted that certain information is reserved for users authenticated to recieve it. For example, non-admin users who make GET requests to the endpoint `/users` will recieve the following output.

```
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "username": "john_smith",
    "name": "John Smith",
    "state": "active",
    "avatar_url": "http://localhost:3000/uploads/user/avatar/1/cd8.jpeg",
    "web_url": "http://localhost:3000/john_smith"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "username": "jack_smith",
    "name": "Jack Smith",
    "state": "blocked",
    "avatar_url": "http://gravatar.com/../e32131cd8.jpeg",
    "web_url": "http://localhost:3000/jack_smith"
  }
]
```

This being the bare minimum amount of information about a user gitlab will return, however, users with administrative powers will recieve far more.

```
  {
    "id": 1,
    "username": "john_smith",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "name": "John Smith",
    "state": "active",
    "avatar_url": "http://localhost:3000/uploads/user/avatar/1/index.jpg",
