# Leptos Todo App Sqlite with Axum

This example creates a basic todo app with an Axum backend that uses Leptos' server functions to call sqlx from the client and seamlessly run it on the server.
Api endpoints are detailed with the swagger ui utilizing Utopia, a Rust crate for programmatically documenting APIs

## Getting Started

See the Examples README from the main leptos repository

Provide the absolute path to a sqllite db file to the DB_FILE environment variable.
